        <h4> Sukamii is a Brand that draws motivation from fashion icons like Nigo and Takashi Murakami. Im drawn to the brand because I feel like Mr. Hollins creates a very cool brand identity.</h4>
       <h4> He keeps this brand identity by using the same base character and changine colors, materials, and shape of the character to make each hoodie or t shirt different but still on brand. </h4>
        <h4>Mr. Hollins also creates a lot of plushes and figures that can be great decorations!</h4>

        <h4>I really like how this artist combines 90s videogame-styled graphics with the automotive scene. Their work captures the 90s Japanese drift scene mood perfectly. The use of bright </h4>
       <h4>and bold colors, attention to detail, and grainy 90s graphics create the perfect mood. This account really inspires me because I love both 90s video games and cars. This gives me hope  </h4>
        <h4> that I can end up having a job that combines design and cars. I'm really into learning about the 90s car culture. Specifically, the 90s drifting scene when it all started.</h4>
