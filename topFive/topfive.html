        <p>These are my favorite cars ever! In order from right to left, the Nissan Stagea RS4 is am impressive stationwagon with the engine and drivetrain from the famous R34 GTR.</p>
        <p>The Nissan C35 Laurel is a rear wheel drive manual sedan with an RB25 neo engine. These cars are popular in Japan because of their ability to drift and their cheap price. </p>
        <p>The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 9 was the last EVO to get the famous 4G63 motor. With this high compression four cylinder turbo engine, it is easy to tune up and gain power.</p>
        <p>The eighth generation Civic Mugen RR is an exceptionally rare car limited to 200 production cars. It has the full catalog of Mugen upgrades and a very powerful k20Z3 engine.</p>
        <p> last but not least is the Audi B5 RS4 Avant. This all wheel drive V6 powered stationwagon comes with a manual transmission and looks the best out of all of Audis Avant models.</p>

        <p>These are my favorite Animes of all time in no particular order! Fullmetal Alchemist was the second Anime I ever watched and I fell in love with the concept and characters very fast.</p>
        <p>Mob Psycho is very special to me becuase I could connect so much with the main character at the time. The show explores emotions and it helped me become more comfortable with my emotions.</p>
        <p>Code Geass is a wondeful Anime that gets into political power and war. It sounds dark, but the creators did an amazing job creating a story that was very attention grabbing.</p>
        <p>Frieren is a fantasy Anime that was written almost perfectly. They did an incredible job with making the female characters powerful, interesting, and respectful which is very uncommon.</p>
        <p>Jujutsu kaisen is my favorite running Anime currenty. It has dark themes and extremely intersting characters and power structure. The characters have so much depth and emotion and the story is amazing.</p>
